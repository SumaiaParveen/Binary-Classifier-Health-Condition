# Prediction of Biopsy, Colposcopy, Cytology and Schiller's Test Result from Demographic, Habitual and Medical Records

## Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a womanâ€™s test resukt for cervical cancer would be positive or negative with the help of a machine learning model.

## Methodology

Several machine learning algorithms are applied to see which model works better on this particular dataset. Before that, 15 important features are selected after applying five feature selection/ feature importance methods. Outlier/ important observation and their impact have also been taken care of.

## About the Dataset

Source:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29 

The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. Several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns (Missing not at Random).
