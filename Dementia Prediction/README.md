# Dementia Prediction from MRI Data

## Objective

We want to predict whether a person is demented or not the MRI data. Two different analyses have been made from the MRI data of different age groups:

1. Young, Middle Aged Person ====> [Cross-sectional MRI Data](https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/tree/main/Dementia%20Prediction/Cross-sectional%20MRI%20Data)

2. Older Adults ====> [Longitudinal MRI Data]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/tree/main/Dementia%20Prediction/Longitudinal%20MRI%20Data)

## About the Dataset

The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies [(OASIS)](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community. [OASIS](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) is made available by the Washington University Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center, Dr. Randy Buckner at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)( at Harvard University, the Neuroinformatics Research Group (NRG) at Washington University School of Medicine, and the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN).

## Methodology
Several machine learning algorithms are applied to see which model works better on this particular dataset. Before that, 15 important features are selected after applying five feature selection/ feature importance methods. Outlier/ important observation and their impact have also been taken care of.
