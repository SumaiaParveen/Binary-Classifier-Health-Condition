# Binary-Classification of Prevalence of Health Conditions using Machine Learning Techniques

## Objective
The purpose of this study is to try out different datasets and gain skills on binary classification using different machine learning algorithms. Importance on various feature engineering techniques and interpretation of domain-based performance evaluation metrics were also given. 

Information and source of the datasets are provided in corresponding folders. Also, sneak peaks of each analysis are included in the README.md files in the corresponding folders.
Analyses have been made on 5 health conditions

1.	Breast Cancer ====>  see details [here]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20%20Prediction/README.md)
2.	Cervical Cancer ====>  see details [here]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/blob/main/Cervical%20Cancer%20Test%20Result%20Prediction/README.md)
3.	Chronic Kidney Disease ====>  see details [here]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/blob/main/Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20Prediction/README.md)
4.	Alzheimer's Disease ====>  see details [here]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/blob/main/Dementia%20Prediction/README.md)
5.	Parkinsonâ€™s Disease ====>  see details [here]( https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Binary-Classifier-Health-Condition/blob/main/Parkinsons%20Prediction/README.md)
